	<h1>More about websites</h1>
<p>What happens when you try to sell a house with an overgrown garden, cracks in the driveway, and a broken front door? No offers, right? That’s exactly why you need the best homepage design for your website.

Think of your homepage as analogous to a home’s curb appeal. It’s the first thing many people see when they visit your website, so you want to wow them from the second the page loads.

But it’s not just about aesthetics. You also want your homepage to convert. As I said above, a broken front door and an inaccessible driveway prevents future buyers from even considering the sale. The same goes for your website.

People can’t or won’t convert if you don’t give them an incentive to do so and if you don’t make converting as easy and intuitive as possible.

The first step in winning over more customers is to understand the essential elements that should go into every homepage.

Once you’ve mastered the basics, draw inspiration from 31 top homepage designs so you can find out what will work best for your business and your audience.</p>

<h1>The Benefits of a Well-Designed Homepage</h1>
<p>A simple homepage design welcomes your audience to your site, tells them what you want them to do next, and allows them to explore your site in more depth.

You can layer on more complexity, but you don’t want to start with a cluttered mess and have to selectively prune it. Always begin with the basics. When you begin planning out your homepage design, make sure every element satisfies at least one of the following four goals.

<h1>What do you need on your homepage? What will your audience expect? And which elements take priority?</h1>

<p>When you can answer those questions, you’ll have the information you need for better homepage design. In web design, homepage elements have very specific purposes.

Helping your target audience get to know your business
Many of your website visitors will find your homepage first. With that in mind, you need to make a solid first impression.

Your homepage should provide a sense of your company’s values, unique selling proposition (USP), and purpose. You’re more likely to lure in potential customers if you can effectively communicate this information.

Improving the user experience on your website
Consumers visit your website with a purpose. It could be to check out your product line, read your blog posts, or find out if you sell a particular type of service.

Regardless, you want to direct that consumer to the appropriate page. Your homepage design should facilitate this transition by providing intuitive navigation and a sense of how your website flows.</p>
